# ilo kalama

A musical instrument designed around being playable on a smartphone.

I was inspired to make a musical instrument after watching [Wintergatan's modulin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaW5K85UDR0).
5 years after making an iOS app for my own personal use, I made a web version for anyone to try.

The timbre was chosen to resemble that of a theremin. 
The name comes from the [toki pona](https://www.tokipona.org) for 'musical instrument'.
